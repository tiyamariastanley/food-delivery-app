# food-delivery-app

This is an abstract version of the Swiggy food delivery app. It simulates the core features of food delivery, including browsing restaurants, searching and adding items to the cart.

# Notes:
To run this app, please ensure to start it in no-cors mode to avoid any cross-origin issues as the API used in the app (Swiggy api) is not public.
